Going back in my memories from the latest job to the very beginning of my career I remember that while I was still attending university I started a small business offering coffee internet navigation, computers selling and
accessories, which set me in the very first steps of this industry; while working in this business I had the opportunity to basically take any work computer-related where the customer asked for it, I became self taught on multiple software and applications, I learned to build computers and found myself selling those; people in the area started to ask for crash courses about how to learn/use various software so then, I started to offering crash courses Microsoft Office, Corel Draw, Dreamweaver, programming courses in Borlad Pascal for high school student etc.
