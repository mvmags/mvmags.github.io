## About myself

I'm a mexican native, I was born and raised in the Aguascalientes state of Mexico, I started early with the world of computers during middle schoole time when a door to door salesman knocked out at our house door to sell a brand new course about how to use computers and devices, I got immediately interested on it and for sure I got enrolled in the course, it turned out to be a a very basic course basically to learn how to properly type in the keyboard and use some applications, and also learn to make use of the scanner (which to be honest it was the most interest part of the cours), from then on I continued to get involved in learning everything I could about computers, languages, during middle school and high school I learned to code in Fox Pro, Turbo Pascal, Borland Pascal, started to understand concepts of databases with Microsoft Access and apps related. During my University time, I gained interest in learning about networks, while at the same time learning, I'd say old languages like Assembly Language, until the internet disrupted everything, and I started to learn how to code in Java.

While studying at the University, I started my own business (Coffee Internet) along with my sister and a cousin. We sold devices and assembled computers (we bought parts separately and assembled them into a new computer). During my early jobs, I had roles like business owner, desk support, developer, web developer, along with a family side that dragged me into playing roles in the family business of restaurant, agriculture, and others.

After finishing college, I moved to a new job, which marked the start of my formal journey as a developer. I have had the opportunity to gain experience developing, implementing and delivering enterprise solutions including cloud-based across healthcare, fintech, and analytics domains, lately focused in Node.js, Java, and AWS ecosystem with proven success working remote, agile teams for Fortune 500 clients.
